-- Exercises on REGIONS, a problem per query that reads REGIONS alone, at the basic level.
--
-- These are the basic SQL solutions of the 'REGIONS' section of EXERCISES.asciidoc, which also states each problem in
-- full and gives its JPQL solutions and notes. Each problem below repeats the request it answers.
--
-- Parameters are bind variables (:name); the IDE or SQL*Plus prompts for them when a statement runs.

-- A report parameter arrives as a region name typed by a user, in whatever case; the report needs the region.
SELECT REGION_ID, REGION_NAME
FROM REGIONS
WHERE UPPER(REGION_NAME) = UPPER(:regionName)
