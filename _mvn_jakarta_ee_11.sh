# Runs a Maven build against every supported Jakarta EE 11 combination.
#
# Jakarta EE 11 is the only supported platform generation and its values live in the
# root pom's <properties>, so the platform is identical in every run below; only the
# implementations vary. The profiles form two axes -- persistence provider (__) and
# validator (___) -- and because the defaults are activeByDefault, naming a profile on
# one axis deactivates the others: every combination therefore names all of them.
#
# `clean` is prepended to whatever you pass, and is not optional. The annotation processor writes a
# metamodel under target/generated-*-sources per provider, and the two providers do not generate the
# same one; without a clean between combinations the second provider compiles against the first's
# leftovers and every combination after the first fails with "cannot find symbol" on generated
# classes which look nothing like the problem.
#
# Usage: ./_mvn_jakarta_ee_11.sh [maven args...]   e.g. ./_mvn_jakarta_ee_11.sh test
